# Country Two Step

## About
The two-step is a partnered progressive dance that proceeds counterclockwise around the floor.  The partners generally begin in closed position with the leader facing the line of dance. The follower stands facing the leader. In a traditional "frame" the leader places his/her right hand over his/her partner's left shoulder. In the more contemporary styling, closed position is formed by placing the right hand under the follower's left arm, and on his/her back. In either case the leader holds the follower's right hand in his/her left hand at about shoulder height.

Traditionally, Two Step includes three steps: a quick step, a quick step, and then a slow step. In modern times, this is also known as Texas Polka. It can be danced to music with either a 2/4 or 4/4 time signature.
