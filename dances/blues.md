## About
Blues dancing is a family of historical dances that developed alongside and were danced to blues music, or the contemporary dances that are danced in that aesthetic. Amateur Dancer carried an article titled "Blues and Rhythm and Blues Dancing" in a July/August 1991 issue.

Mura Dehn used the term The Blues in The Spirit Moves, Part 1, as the sub section title of Chapter II, referencing different dance styles.  African American essayist and novelist Albert Murray used the term "blues-idiom dance" and "blues-idiom dance movement" in his book "Stomping the Blues".
