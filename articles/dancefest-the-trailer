# DanceFest: The Trailer
2013-01-03

It's a new year, and time to step it up from what came before.  As we've mentioned before, DanceFest is different from other events - we're going that extra mile.

Not just a hotel, but a Casino.
Not just one dance, but many dances.
Not just one top-notch teacher, but many famous teachers.

So let's kick off 2013 with the coolest trailer you've seen for *any* dance event.

Seriously.

This is DanceFest.

And we're just getting started.
