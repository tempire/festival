# DanceFest Sponsors
2013-01-09

We're very thankful to our two main sponsors, Scherba Media and DanceAway Designs.

### Scherba Media
Scherba Media is a full service media firm providing the best in contemporary media to Chico and surrounding areas.  Whether small or large, Scherba Media has packages that can fit your budget - from simple websites to hot shot promo videos...remember the trailer released last week?  Yeah...that's Scherba Media work.  They can do the same for you online, or provide the production for your live event.  Whether it be a Fund raiser, Fashion show, or a private wedding, Scherba Media has you covered.

### DanceAway
You probably already know, is *the* place to go for dance supplies.  Ballet and tap, baton and roller skating, ballroom and swing, they have everything.

There's more though - did you know DanceAway also has a unique line of Yoga-wear?  It's pretty nifty stuff you won't find anywhere else.

They've also expanded with their new West Coast Swing corner - hot little outfits and super cute dresses chosen specifically for you to stand out on the floor.

And seriously, you don't know anything until you've seen the custom dance shoes they can deliver.

DanceAway is more than just a shop, they're involved in the community - their weekly blog tells you what's going on and gives you inside reviews on the latest products.  They have decades (literally, decades) of experience.  When you walk in the store, tell them where you're dancing and they probably aleady know the details of what you need.

Ready for the best part?  

It's all available online.  You can get all your danceaway supplies any time from their easy new site, http://danceawaydesigns.com/

DanceFest is made possible by a lot of effort from our dance communityDanceFest is about one thing - having a great time.  As such, we want to do something a little different than you see at most dance events: we want to showcase *all* the benefits you get for the weekend.  One of the best benefits - a full service casino.  We wanted to capture some of the magic, so we went out and took our own photos - that's right, these aren't just stock, these are custom photos taken at Gold Country directly for S1 DanceFest.  Available dishes, rooms, and available facilities: take a closer look.

### Classes

The classes will be held in in large, beautifully well-lit rooms, with ceiling-to-floor windows.  The classes are held right next to each other, so there's no danger of getting lost as you navigate the event.

As you drop in to each class, stop by the Espresso Bar to get your energy fix - you can't miss it - it's *10 feet from each classroom*.

### Food

We're not talking just basic options here - Gold Country has a huge buffet available with beautifully prepared salads, entrees, and desserts.  

There is also a 24-hour cafe for late-nights; there's no reason you need to go hungry as you're dancing, whether it's mid-afternoon or 3 in the morning.

If you want something a little nicer, a full-service steakhouse is waiting for you.  This isn't your average Outback dinner, but rather high-class chefs creating mouth-watering dishes available only at Gold Country.

And yes, that is bacon-wrapped filet mignon.

### Rooms

If you decide you want to spend your evenings lounging instead of driving home, you can stay in one of Gold Country's affordable suites.  We'll be providing a block of rooms you can rent alongside a delightful balcony.  If the weather is nice, the balcony may be used to host part of the event.

### Extras
<img src="http://s1dancefest.com/images/articles/showcase-the-venue/spirits.jpg" style="float: left; margin-left: 0px;" />
If you want to loosen up a bit, there's plenty of spirits available at Gold Country's spirit lounge, and 10 on-tap brews for the beer lovers.  You can even stop by the piano bar for break.  And last but not least - it's a casino!  If you want to try your hand at some of the games, it's only a step or two away.
