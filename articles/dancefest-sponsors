# DanceFest Sponsors
2013-01-09

We're very thankful to our two main sponsors, Scherba Media and DanceAway Designs.

### Scherba Media
Scherba Media is a full service media firm providing the best in contemporary media to Chico and surrounding areas.  Whether small or large, Scherba Media has packages that can fit your budget - from simple websites to hot shot promo videos...remember the trailer released last week?  Yeah...that's Scherba Media work.  They can do the same for you online, or provide the production for your live event.  Whether it be a Fund raiser, Fashion show, or a private wedding, Scherba Media has you covered.

### DanceAway
You probably already know, is *the* place to go for dance supplies.  Ballet and tap, baton and roller skating, ballroom and swing, they have everything.

There's more though - did you know DanceAway also has a unique line of Yoga-wear?  It's pretty nifty stuff you won't find anywhere else.

They've also expanded with their new West Coast Swing corner - hot little outfits and super cute dresses chosen specifically for you to stand out on the floor.

And seriously, you don't know anything until you've seen the custom dance shoes they can deliver.

DanceAway is more than just a shop, they're involved in the community - their weekly blog tells you what's going on and gives you inside reviews on the latest products.  They have decades (literally, decades) of experience.  When you walk in the store, tell them where you're dancing and they probably aleady know the details of what you need.

Ready for the best part?  

It's all available online.  You can get all your danceaway supplies any time from their easy new site, http://danceawaydesigns.com/
