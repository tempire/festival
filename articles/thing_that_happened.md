## This is a thing that happened
Aug 30th, 2012

A less known, but very important feature of <a href="http://mojolicio.us">Mojolicious</a> is the ability to add your own commands to your web application.  These commands can ship with your app, so that your management utilities have direct knowledge of your application.

These are some examples of commands that ship with the framework:

<div class="well" style="overflow: auto; width: 100%; padding: 5px 10px; margin-top: -10px; background-color: #D4EBF7;">

<dl style="width: 33%; float: left;">
<dt>routes</dt>
<dd>Prints out the routes of your web app</dd>
</dl>

<dl style="width: 33%; float: left;">
<dt>generate makefile</dt>
<dd>Generates a makefile specifically for your web app</dd>
</dl>
