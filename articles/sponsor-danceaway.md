DanceAway is more than just a shop, they're involved in the community - the blog, Facebook, and Twitter feed tell you what's going on and gives you inside reviews on the most popular products. They have decades (literally, decades) of experience. When you walk in the store, tell them where you're dancing and they probably aleady know the details of what you need.
