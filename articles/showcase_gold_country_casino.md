# Showcase: Gold Country Casino
2012-09-10

DanceFest is about one thing - having a great time.  As such, we want to do something a little different than you see at most dance events: we want to showcase *all* the benefits you get for the weekend.  One of the best benefits - a full service casino.  We wanted to capture some of the magic, so we went out and took our own photos - that's right, these aren't just stock, these are custom photos taken at Gold Country directly for S1 DanceFest.  Available dishes, rooms, and available facilities: take a closer look.

### Classes

The classes will be held in in large, beautifully well-lit rooms, with ceiling-to-floor windows.  The classes are held right next to each other, so there's no danger of getting lost as you navigate the event.

As you drop in to each class, stop by the Espresso Bar to get your energy fix - you can't miss it - it's *10 feet from each classroom*.

### Food

We're not talking just basic options here - Gold Country has a huge buffet available with beautifully prepared salads, entrees, and desserts.  

There is also a 24-hour cafe for late-nights; there's no reason you need to go hungry as you're dancing, whether it's mid-afternoon or 3 in the morning.

If you want something a little nicer, a full-service steakhouse is waiting for you.  This isn't your average Outback dinner, but rather high-class chefs creating mouth-watering dishes available only at Gold Country.

And yes, that is bacon-wrapped filet mignon.

### Rooms

If you decide you want to spend your evenings lounging instead of driving home, you can stay in one of Gold Country's affordable suites.  We'll be providing a block of rooms you can rent alongside a delightful balcony.  If the weather is nice, the balcony may be used to host part of the event.

### Extras

If you want to loosen up a bit, there's plenty of spirits available at Gold Country's spirit lounge, and 10 on-tap brews for the beer lovers.  You can even stop by the piano bar for break.  And last but not least - it's a casino!  If you want to try your hand at some of the games, it's only a step or two away.
