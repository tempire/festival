# What is the DanceFest?
2012-07-15

DanceFest is a 4-day dance festival where you can learn a wide variety of dances, including Ballroom and club style genres. The focus, in addition to classes, is lots and lots and lots of social dancing.  

Social Dancing starts early, and goes all night long. We want to throw an event that brings all of the diverse communities in Northern California together for one fantastic dance and fun filled weekend.  

Chico and its surrounding area has been a unique community for a long time.  Ballroom, Lindy Hop, West Coast Swing - no matter what the style, dancers of all ages have made our community different from anywhere else in the world.  Indeed; this is not rhetoric, world travelers have come through Chico and noted that there is no other dance community like it - anywhere.

There was a time when Chico had 200 people coming out on a weekly basis, dancing all the ballroom dances, all having a super great time, and willing to get out on the floor no matter what was playing.

Chico State's ballroom program spawned 100s of dancers per year, all focused on one thing above all - having a damned good time.

That's what S1 Dance Fest is all about.  Having a great time, without any pretense.  Come join us.
