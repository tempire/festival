# DanceFest: The Trailer
2013-01-03

It's a new year; time to step it up from what came before.  As we've mentioned, DanceFest is different from other events, so we're going that extra mile to make sure this event is a premium, fresh experience.  Towards that end, we have something special for you: The DanceFest Trailer.

This is just a taste of the effort we're putting forth.

Not just a hotel, but a Casino.

Not just one dance, but many dances.

Not just famous teachers in one genre, but famous teachers is many genres.

DanceFest will expose you to levels of dancing you haven't seen before.  We want to help you take your dancing to the next level, easily and with no stress.

So let's kick off 2013 with the coolest trailer you've seen for *any* dance event.
