# DanceFest: The Trailer
2013-01-03

It's a new year, and time to step it up from what came before.  As we've mentioned before, DanceFest is different from other events, so we're going that extra mile to make sure this event is a premium, fresh experience.  Towards that end, we have something special for you: The DanceFest Trailer.

This is just a taste of the effort we're putting forth.

Not just a hotel, but a Casino.

Not just one dance, but many dances.

Not just one top-notch teacher, but many famous teachers.

DanceFest will expose you to levels of dancing you haven't seen before in these genres.  We want to help you take your dancing to the next level, easily and hassle-free.

So let's kick off 2013 with the coolest trailer you've seen for *any* dance event.

Seriously.

This is DanceFest.

And we're just getting started.
