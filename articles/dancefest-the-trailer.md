It's a new year; time to step it up from what came before.  As we've mentioned, DanceFest is different from other events, so we're going that extra mile to make sure this event is a premium, fresh experience.  Towards that end, we have something special for you: The DanceFest Trailer.

This is just a taste of the effort we're putting forth.
