# DanceFest: The Trailer
2013-01-03

It's a new year; time to step it up from what came before.  As we've mentioned, DanceFest is different from other events, so we're going that extra mile to make sure this event is a premium, fresh experience.  Towards that end, we have something special for you: The DanceFest Trailer.

This is just a taste of the effort we're putting forth.

*Not just a hotel, but a Casino.*

*Not just famous teachers for one dance, but famous teachers is many dances.*

Let's kick off 2013 with the coolest video you've seen for *any* dance event.
