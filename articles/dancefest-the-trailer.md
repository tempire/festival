# DanceFest: The Trailer

It's a new year - time to step it up from what came before.  As we've previously mentioned, DanceFest is different from other events; we're going that extra mile to make sure this event is a premium, fresh experience.

Towards that end, we have something special for you: The DanceFest Trailer.
