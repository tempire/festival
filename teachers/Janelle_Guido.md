## About
Janelle Guido started ballet and tap dance lessons when she was five years old. Her first class performance was something she’ll never forget because she watched it from the front row seat, due to severe stage fright.

When Janelle was 18 years old, she went to her first West Coast Swing Dance event and discovered that she had completely out grown her stage fright. Dancing instantly became her passion! Janelle was asked to be on the Buddy Schwimmer’s Dance Team which was a great learning experience!

Last year she was invited to be an instructor for a Dancing with the Stars fundraiser for a performing arts theater in Sonoma County. Janelle and her Star received first place! Now five years later, Janelle has danced her way to the All-Star level. She is absolutely passionate about dancing and thoroughly enjoys sharing her love for dance. You will find her every Tuesday night at the WnY Warehouse ( In Novato, California ) teaching classes of her favorite dance...West Coast Swing!!

Janelle's enthusiasm for dance is extremely evident in her teaching as well as every time she steps on a dance floor! Janelle loves her "Dance Family" and wishes to thank everyone who has been so amazingly supportive and tremendously encouraging!
