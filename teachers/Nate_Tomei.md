## About
What started out as a freshman PE class at Chico State unexpectedly blossomed into a lifelong passion for Nate.  After spending a few years in the classes as a student and teaching assistant, Nate began teaching workshops for the premiere ballroom club in town run by a fellow who would turn out to be one of the greatest ballroom dance catalysts this area has ever seen.  He goes by Luke Scherba; perhaps you've heard of him.  Eventually, Nate was teaching the class at Chico State before relocation took him out of town.
 
Now closer to Sacramento, Nate was able to join Yemaya Salsa and perform for a variety of venues, including the halftime show of an Oakland Raiders football game (it didn't help them win, though).  One of his most treasured experiences from this period of Nate's life was being able to study salsa right from the source under a fiesty Cuban lady in Havana. 
 
Before long, Nate found himself relocated again, this time to upstate New York, where he was able to connect with Lorraine-Michael's Dance Studio.  New opportunities in a new state included teaching at the studio and also learning what would become one of his favorite dances - casino rueda.  Having taught at both the collegiate and professional levels, Nate has gained an appreciation for the unique character and makeup of not only each dance, but each group of students in his classes.
 
While able to teach a variety of ballroom, latin, and swing dances, Nate's favorite style to dance and teach is salsa and its group component rueda.  Nate prefers a connection-based approach to dancing rather than choreography, enabling students to experience and explore a dance on their own through true lead and follow rather than be limited to a patterned sequence.  Nate has preferred to stay away from competition, believing that there really is no 'wrong' way to dance as long as nobody's getting hurt.
