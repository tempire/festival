## About
Devin McBain's dance journey began at age 3 when she fell in love with bellydance, her mother's chosen style.  She began performing with and choreographing for the bellydance troupe Parvati at age 12, and she started placing in bellydance competitions at age 13.  She now competes at the professional level, and she is proud to be a house dancer at Marrakech Moroccan Restaurant in Sacramento since 2011.

However, it is impossible for her to only bellydance.  Devin also started dancing hip-hop at age 12, jazz at age 14, and ballet at age 17.  She was also a member of the indoor color guard unit at her local high school, and she was asked to choreograph her own solos and lead warm-up drills for her peers during her term as guard captain.  At age 19, after 1 1/2 years of training, she had progressed so quickly in ballet technique that she was invited to teach youth and introductory levels of ballet at HYPE Dance Studio, where she is currently on staff.  She discovered ballroom and swing at Studio One at age 20; since then she has begun competing in West Coast Swing, and she has placed in Novice Strictly divisions.

Devin is also in her senior year at California State University, Chico, and she will receive two degrees in Chemistry and in Biochemistry this December.  She is always excited to share her knowledge of both dance and science with those who are willing to learn, and she looks forward to dancing as much as possible throughout her career as a chemistry professor.
