## About
Jason has been dancing for 19 years and been instructing for 11. He began dancing in 1990 during the country craze, focusing primarily on country until he discovered his undoubted passion of West Coast Swing, which has been his life ever since. He is currently competing in Champion level West Coast Swing on the Nationwide Circuit, having many recent wins.  He primarily teaches two forms of dance, West Coast Swing and Lindy Hop, although he also teaches Salsa and Ballroom.

His very unique style and presence make him sought after all over the US and Europe.  Jason is a very dedicated instructor who leads his students into mind-opening experiences by teaching his own version of lead/follow and movement; many students have claimed Jasonâ€™s teaching has lead them to a completely new understanding of dance. In addition to teaching adults, Jason also loves teaching children and is currently teaching PE curriculum programs for schools around the San Francisco Bay area.
