## About
Jason Taylor has been dancing competitive West Coast Swing for the past six years and was raised through the instruction of champion dancer Sean McKeaver and constant support of his loving, caring, handsome and talented brother, Matthew Taylor. Jason regularly competes at the all star level and took first place at Chico Dance Sensation 2011 (he really wanted to impress Matthew). Now he teaches every week at the WnY Warehouse and pushes himself everyday to not only become a better dancer, but also the best instructor he can be.
