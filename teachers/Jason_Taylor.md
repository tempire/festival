## About
Jason Taylor has been competing in West Coast Swing for five years and currently dances in the All-Star division.  He has been introduced to multiple forms of dance but none of them enticed him as much as West Coast Swing. He loves the community and the support that surrounds it.  Being able to teach and help the dance grow is a great opportunity and always a pleasure to take part in.  It is an addicting dance and he hopes that it continues to grow all around the world.
