## About
Olivia has been in love with partner dancing for her entire life, long before she began to learn.  Once she started learning, she became addicted - she absorbed all the Ballroom, Latin, and Swing dances at Chico State, and has kept dancing for the past seven years.  Eventually, West Coast Swing became her passion; she began traveling to conventions and competing up and down the west coast and has been doing so for the last five years.  For the past three years, she has been teaching West Coast professionally, teaching at conventions and workshops all over the world.  She appreciates and trust the structure and technique that West Coast has, while loving the variability and inspiration the dance allows.  She hopes to transfer her excitement for West Coast to anyone willing to learn and watch.
