## About
Andrew Slac is a professional Lindy Hop, West Coast Swing and Hip Hop teacher, dancer and choreographer from Portland, Oregon.

We've captured several quotes from Andrew in his travels to give you an idea of who he his and how he works:

<blockquote>I've been dancing the majority of my life. The first dancer I really latched on to was Bob Fosse, then Salah Benlemqawanssa and basically every single other dancer I saw after that. I've trained with the best, and still attribute my passion and success to Steven Mitchell and Virginie Jensen (http://www.stevenandvirginie.com/).They gave me the spirit, and I can't thank them enough. After that, I soaked up all of the training I could, traveled, competed and taught. My life is basically amazing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>My purpose is to raise up those around me and make them realize and appreciate just how incredible they are, on and off the dance floor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If I could give someone a bit of advice about dance, it would be to look for that perfect moment in any dance, whether it be a class, performance or just a night out on the dance floor. Let go of everything and just live.</blockquote>

He currently manages <a href="http://nonsensedance.webstarts.com/">Nonsense Dance Company</a>, choreographing and training in Hip Hop, Contemporary and Jazz. Andrew primarily teaches out of <a href="http://www.vegadancelab.com/">Vega Dance + Lab</a>, located in Portland, Oregon.
